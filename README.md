# Arzigogoli_SO

These are the solutions that I have tried to provide for some "arzigogoli" (quiddity) exercises from the ["Sistemi Operativi"](https://weblab.ing.unimore.it/people/andreolini/didattica/sistemi-operativi/2020-21/) course.

These are extra challenges that the Professor assigned during the weekend optionally with the intention of practicing the use of bash and various Debian tools.
