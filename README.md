# Arzigogoli_SO

These are the solutions that I have tried to provide for some "arzigogoli" (quiddity) exercises from the "Sistemi Operativi" course.

These are extra exercises that the Professor assigned during the weekend optionally with the intention of practicing the use of bash and various Debian tools.
